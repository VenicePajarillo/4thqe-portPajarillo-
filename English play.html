     <p>As the costume head for this play, it was for sure stressful but as usual
      I had fun giving life to our bright ideas. I have seen the way this section evolved,
      needless to say, I am very proud of who and what we have become as a team and as an
      individual person. This play mirrors who fairness is—we may not be perfect but we're 
      perfectly fine. (not really, we are literally falling apart—together or individually—
      EVERY SINGLE TIME, It's so entertaining to witness. I hope you see our very unprepared 
      play Ms. and I hope while you watch it, you'll see each one of us who put our bopod, sweat, and tears
      for this, either as an actor, head or a member.
