    Reflection </h1>
  
  <p>This quarter for ICT was a bit chill except for the e-port which I <br>
    honestly struggle with a lot. Honestly, I enjoy every session except <br>
    the hands on which I failed (Mine didn't work and it was one of those <br>
    moments where I know enough to know something was wrong in my code but <br>
    not enough to know what it isâ€”yes it's painful) Anyhow, I enjoyed the new <br>
    teaching way of Ms. U which she let us encode the code ourselves and I think <br>
    that helps with our memory. It would have been more helpful to me if I'm not <br>
    a slow typer and if I can actually the TV screen. Overall, this quarter was <br>
    exhausting but I'm happy with ICT, at least it was a helpful subject for our overall <br>
    wellness in this hell quarter. I can't belive this school year will officially end and <br>
    I'm coding this website (I'm struggling to emphasize) knowing it'll be the last e-port <br>
    I'll do for ICT and for Ms. U. <br> <br> We'll Miss U, Ms. U! </p>
